## Exercise I

a) Big(O) ~ O(n^3)

For *each unit increase* in n, the number of iterations increases ~n^3 fold. For example, If we increase n from 1 to 2, the number of iterations increases from 1*1*1 = 1 to 2*2*2 = 8, an increase of 7 which approximates to 8. 


b) Big(O) ~ O(n^2)
 
The number of iterations approximates n^2, as the first loop iterates n times, and for each of these loops there is a second loop that iterates (n-1)^2 times. Therefore, with each increase in n, the increase in iteration approximates O(n^2)


c) BigO ~ O(n) or linear
For each increase in n, the number of recurions incrases by 1. Another way to look at this is to take an example: If bunnies = 2, then the process runs thrice. If it is 3, then it runs four times.
